### Issue Workflow

- create an issue, pick "Bug report" or "Feature Request" from the templates
- the issue will be assigned a "new" label
- we will check on these issues regularly, add them to a milestone and remove the "new" label
- once we added the feature or fixed the bug in any release (also dev/nightly) we will close the issue
- stable releases will have a changelog with all the closed issues
