# Standalone - FAQ

## How can I run cables standalone in fullscreen/presentation mode

To start cables standalone in fullscreen and/or open the renderer in fullscreen on start, use the following
command line arguments.

- `--fullscreen` open editor in fullscreen window on start
- `--maximize-renderer` maximize the renderer to window size on start

Use `--help` for more info.

## Where can I find more information and tutorials to get started?

There are plenty of tutorial videos on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/cables_gl), some cover specific standalone topics. Feel free to suggest
topics, if you think something is missing or subscribe to the channel to get notified once we add a new video.

## I am having issues playing videos in cables standalone

Most of the videos around should play fine. If you encounter error-messages containing "ffmpg" that video format is likely
not supported by cables, electron and/or your operating system. This then is an issue with proprietary video codecs, and
we cannot really do anything about that...sorry...

## I get weird results when using filenames or file system-paths across operating systems

As a general rule of thumb: Whenever cables uses files, it's using URLs. URLs of local files look like this:

`file:/home/cables/myfile.txt` or `file:/C:/Users/cables/myfile.txt`

Notice the forward slashes. To keep this OS-independent, whenever you deal with files, try to use file-url.
There are ops to convert [back](https://cables.gl/op/Ops.Extension.Standalone.Files.PathToFileUrl) and [forth](https://cables.gl/op/Ops.Extension.Standalone.Files.PathToFileUrl) between URLs and paths.

## How can I support the development of cables and the standalone version?

Most definitely, check out the general section on [supporting cables](../../faq/faq) . Thank you!
