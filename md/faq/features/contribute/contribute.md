# How to contribute code to cables

So you found something missing in cables, integrated a new technology or fixed a bug? Awesome!

The easiest way to contribute this to cables - for now - is to [write your user-op](../../../5_writing_ops/dev_ops/dev_ops) and then do one of the following:

- post your code on the [public issue tracker](https://github.com/cables-gl/cables_docs/issues)
- post your code to the [forums](https://forum.cables.gl/)
- contact us on [discord](https://discord.gg/AGTarWv)

We will then take a look at it and get back to you. Thanks for contributing!

Please make sure beforehand that your code adheres to the guidlines in this documentation and is free of any licences that would prohibit commercial use, or include some "copyleft" clauses. 
We prefer the [MIT Licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Should we accept you contribution your code will also be put under MIT Licence and you will be properly credited.
