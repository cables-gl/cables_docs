# Cables at schools and universities

## Teaching cables

Cables is used at more and more universities, being completely free and [MIT-licenced](../licence_payment/licence/licence).

It's easy to get started, has a vast amount of examples and documentation and it does not need more than a browser and an internet connection. All of this makes it perfectly suited for classrooms or workshops.

## Need help?

Do you want to introduce cables to your classroom to teach visual coding, arts, data visualisation?

We have held some workshops and seminars at universities and other educational institutions.

Many people in the cables community did the same, at their institutions, in their home countries, in their languages. 
There is plenty of know-how to get you going.

We're always looking for educational institutions who would like to use cables in the classroom. 

Please send us an [email](mailto:hi@undev.de) or contact us on [discord](https://discord.gg/cablesgl) if you'd like us to help you getting started.
