# Export full Patch

Select the "Patch" option in the export dialog on [dev.cables.gl](https://dev.cables.gl). This export will contain
all the assets, any custom ops of the patch (patch, team, subpatch) and can be run in cables standalone.

## Run in cables standalone

Download the latest version of ["cables standalone"](https://dev.cables.gl/downloads).

Install and/or open the standalone version, select "Open Patch" from the menu or the welcome screen, select
the `.cables` file you just downloaded. Start patching!

## Import on cables.gl

Patches that have been exported as a full patch can be re-imported to cables.gl.  To import a patch, go to the [import tab](/mydata#import) 
in the "My Data" section on cables.gl and upload the Zip created during export or manual backup. 

Read more in the documentation on [importing patches](../../import/import) for further steps.
