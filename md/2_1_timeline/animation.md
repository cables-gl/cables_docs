# Timeline Keyframe Animation

We’ve completely rebuilt the Timeline — bringing true keyframing to your patches so you can animate any parameter with precision, from subtle color fades to complex camera moves.
Designed for both developers and motion designers, this is your space to shape motion — set keyframes, curve your easing, and see every change happen in real time.
Rewritten from the ground up with a cleaner interface, better performance and smoother workflow, the Timeline gives you the precision of a professional animation tool, right inside your browser.
