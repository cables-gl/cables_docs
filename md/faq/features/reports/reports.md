# How to report a bug in cables

As cables is in constant development, there will be bugs here and there. We also try to keep our documentation and examples up-to-date but when you notice things not working the way they are described or you expected - Please submit an issue for us following the guidelines below!


## Where to report bugs?

Please keep all bugreports to the [Discussions forum](https://github.com/cables-gl/cables_docs/discussions/categories/bug-reports) .
Check out previously submitted bugs first and if you find a related report, vote it up and post about your findings too. That way we have more details and can see how frequently this bug happens!

## What information to include in my post to GitHub Discussions?

### Description of your environment

First and foremost - tell us what operating system and browser your are using.
Send us the generated link provided on [cables.gl/browser](https://cables.gl/browser) - it will be on top of the page.

Tell us more about your project and how it is running - on mobile? on WordPress? inside the cables.gl editor? 

### A simple step by step explanation that is reproducible

Please include a simple explanation that is showing your issue as isolated as possible.

Attaching a video and screenshot illustrating your issue is great too.

### A small and simple example patch

Please try to isolate the problem and provide a simple example patch that displays what
is going wrong. Provide us with a link in your issue post!

### A screenshot of your browsers dev-console

For most browsers you can open the dev-console by rightclicking anywhere on the page, selecting "inspect element"
and then switching to the console tab. Keep the console open and reproduce the error in your patch.  Please provide a screenshot of the errors reported in the console.

This is a bit harder to do on a mobile-phone, but if you are used to remote-debugging android/ios-devices
a glimpse into your dev-console would help here also.


## I have code that fixes the issue!

Awesome! Please post your findings on our [Discussions forum](https://github.com/cables-gl/cables_docs/discussions/categories/bug-reports) and provide your proposed fixes and solutions. We highly appreciate contributors and community members that go above and beyond. Thanks for contributing and expect a token of our thanks in the mail!
