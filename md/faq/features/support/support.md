# How can I support cables?

## Spread the word!

Helping us grow is the best way to help us - get the word out!

## Money? Projects?

If you want to financially support us, currently your best option would be to spend some cash on the various levels on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cables_gl).
Don't forget to link your Patreon account in [your profile settings](https://cables.gl/settings) to get those sweet, sweet benefits.

We also have a very long list of stuff that WE want to do, but maybe you need something specific for your project
or would like to hire us to develop project specific features. Simply [contact us](mailto:hi@undev.de)!

If you publish your work on a platform like `fxhash` or `objkt`, you might consider giving a share of your sales to our wallet.
Use `cables.tez` or `tz1ixVhzF6uBTYo6vPZ44RoZfcypC5dyvPc6`. Thanks!
