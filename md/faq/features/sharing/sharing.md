# How can I share a patch to get help?

If you are stuck patching, found a bug or just have a question on how to achieve a certain look or effect, it's
always a good idea to patch together a small example and share it with the community.

Create a simple patch showcasing where you need help, set the [visibility](https://dev.cables.gl/docs/5_1_permissions/1_patches/patches)
to either "Public" or "Unlisted - Allow editor" and then share the URL of your patch with the community:

- On [Discord](https://discord.gg/cablesgl), for help and feedback.
- On [Github](https://github.com/cables-gl/cables/issues), if you think you found a bug.
