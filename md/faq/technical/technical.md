# Technical questions

#### What kind of system specs would I need to use cables?

- That depends on what you making with it and how good you are at optimizing your patches.
Patches that have a lot of 3D models and shader effects will need a decent GPU and RAM to work.
Then again a lot of amazing patches run on mobile devices so it's all down to the users experience level.

#### Do I need a good graphics card (GPU) to use cables?

- We'd advise having a the equivalent of a **Nvdia 970M** for any serious graphics work.

#### What kind of input devices can I use with cables?

- Game controllers, midi controllers, mobile phone data such as a gyroscope. See this [page](https://cables.gl/ops/Ops.Device) for a full list of supported devices.

#### Does cables support multiple monitors?

- Not yet. 

#### Is syphon or spout texture sharing available in cables?

- cables cannot support this because it is running in the browser, you need 3rd party capturing software that captures a part of the desktop which is **syphon/spout** compatible.

#### Can I use my soundcard with cables?

- Yes. Though you are limited to 2 audio inputs and 2 audio outputs because of web browser limitations.

#### Is there a standalone version of cables that doesn’t require an internet connection?

- Yes and no. To make and and edit patches you need an internet connection so you can use the cables editor. 
If you have a finished patch you can run it without an internet connection straight from a USB stick. 
It's called Daplaya, you can download it and get started [here](https://github.com/cables-gl/cables-daplaya)

#### Can I embed a cables patch in a wordpress page?

- Yes you can. Check the cables-wordpress-plugin [page](https://github.com/cables-gl/cables-wordpress-plugin) to get started.  

#### Can I make my own custom ops?

- Yes you can. We have a [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJ47_rYdezU&list=PLYimpE2xWgBvKQg65p9q5sa2jJaHGO7Ka&index=2&t=0s) with lots of entry level turorials and a github repo called [coding with cables](https://github.com/cables-gl/coding-with-cables).
You can also click on any cables op and press the **e** key to see the op code.

#### How do I download assets from a patch to my computer?

- Go into the file browser inside of the patch. Then to patch files. Click the asset and then look for the download button.

#### Where are the Tone.js operators?

- They've currently been deprecated. We are planning on rebuilding them and releasing them at some point in the future.
