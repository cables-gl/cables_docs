# How is my work licenced when using cables?

This is a bit of a complicated question, so let's try to break this down:

- Using cables and several of the used open source components does not impose a licence on your work
- What you do in cables is yours, you have the choice of making patches public or not
- Private patches retain all the copyright there is and we will never make patches public or share assets of these
- When making patches public on cables.gl you can choose from any CC licence, a "public domain" option or "all rights reserved"
- This will be shown on cables when viewing the patch
- We do not control or enforce copyright actively, if you see someone abusing your work, we will try to help though.
- What you or your collaborators do with exported patches is completely up to you.
- For uploaded assets please make sure you have the proper rights to use them. We will never use assets of private patches on our own.
