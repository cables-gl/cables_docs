# Exporting Patches

*cables*-Patches can be exported as a zip-file, deployed to several servers, run standalone and be embedded into any website. 
The size of the exported patches are relatively small as only the ops which you use in your patch are packed into the zip-file.

- In the Editor choose `Export` in the menu to open the export dialog
- Use one of the following export services to export your patch:

    - [Export HTML](export_zip/export_zip)
    - [Export to github (pages)](export_github/export_github)
    - [Export and deploy to netlify](export_netlify/export_netlify)
    - [Export creating a standalone executable](export_exe/export_exe)
    - [Export via Iframe](export_embed/export_embed)
    - [Export using the cables command line interface](export_cli/export_cli)
